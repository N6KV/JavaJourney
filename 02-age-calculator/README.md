# Age Calculator 🎂
📅 Hmm... how old was I again?

## 🤔 What this is
This is a simple Java age calculator that calculates and outputs your age after you type in your birthday.
 
## 🚀 Usage
Make sure you have Java (21.0.7) installed. Then run:
```bash
java -jar "Age Calculator.jar"
```
You will be asked for the birth year. Make sure it's within the 32-bit integer limit (I mean... why shouldn't it be?) and then press Enter:
```bash
Please enter the year of birth (YYYY):
```
After that, you'll be asked for the birth month (e.g. 1 = January, 2 = February, 12 = December,...):
```bash
Please enter the month of birth (1-12):
```
Now, you'll need to type in the day of the birth (a number between 1-31 (less depending on the month)):
```bash
Please enter the day of birth (1-31):
```
And just like that, the script will output the result:
```bash
🎂 You are [years] years, [months] months and [days] days old!
```
