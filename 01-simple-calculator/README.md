# Simple Calculator 🧮
➗ Bye bye World, hello Math!

## 🤔 What this is
This is a simple Java calculator that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, all within your terminal.

## 🚀 Usage
Make sure you have Java (21.0.7) installed. Then run:
```bash
java -jar "Simple Calculator.jar"
```
You will be asked for the first number. Make sure it's within the 32-bit integer limit, and then press Enter:
```bash
Enter first number:
```
After that, you'll be asked for a second number. Again, make sure it’s within the 32-bit integer limit:
```bash
Enter second number:
```
Now, input the operator you want to use:
- ```+``` for addition
- ```-``` for subtraction
- ```*``` for multiplication
- ```/``` for division
```bash
Enter operator (+, -, *, /):
```
And just like that, the script will output the result:
```bash
Result: [result]
```
