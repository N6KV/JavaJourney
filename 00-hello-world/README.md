# Hello, World! 🌍
🎉 The start of my exciting Java journey.

## 🤔 What this is
This is a simple Java program that prints `Hello, World!` to the console - the traditional first step into any new programming language.

## 🧪 How to Run
Make sure you have Java (21.0.7) installed. Then run:
```bash
java -jar HelloWorld.jar
```

## 📁 Files
- `Main.java` - contains the main method with the print statement
- `HelloWorld.jar` - compiled JAR to execute the program
